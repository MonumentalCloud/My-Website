The **Triptych** recalls the tradition of triptych of catholic church. In a traditional triptych, three panels of images - each signifying the Jesus, the God, and the Holy Spirit - are hinged together to fold.

Usually these panels come together to tell a cohesive story. In this case, however, the story is not so apparent, except for one thing - the subject is in a passive position to the viewer.
