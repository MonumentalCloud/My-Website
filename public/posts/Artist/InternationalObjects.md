Just as any other installments in "Deprivation Objects" **International Objects** consists of bare minimum conceptual structure, just enough to justify its existence as an art object - without being assigned its pragmatic purpose.

To be international is to be devoid of any national character. The word “international” could also signify a sense of freedom, vagueness, universality,
and loneliness. Thus is the oxymoron of trying to create the
“international objects.” All contents are inherently specific, and is referential.
All contents are inherently organic. Just as border patrols, organic materials
cannot be international for it is too local. To be international is to be mineral,
like metal, Zinc, and possibly, fossilized organic materials. Minerals are all self
referential, and does not rot.
