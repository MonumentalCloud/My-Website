**Default Objects** is the first installment of the "Deprevation Objects" series. Set in the sea of stainless wall enclosure, the experience precludes all sense of time, place, and context. The simplest sculptural shapes imaginable, the black boxes, are set as the default objects in which slight variations in textures and forms are rendered on.
