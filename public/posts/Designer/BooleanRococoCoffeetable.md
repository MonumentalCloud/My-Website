Part of the "Boolean Rococo" series, the coffetable is a study in duality and contrast. The rough texture and the weight of the limestone base of the table is contrasted by the weightlessness of the thin uninterrupted surface of stainless steel. The past and the future clash violently, one intersecting each other to create an oxymoronic utility.
